# Real-Time Human Detection CCTV
This is a personal project for learning.

Nowadays, CCTV used by any people at home, garage, front store,... and one of important feature is Security Mode at night. 
But it always alerts the user with anything motion. 
So the project's target is to upgrade the security mode of CCTV. 
I combine OpenCV Background Subtraction and Yolo-tiny methods to detect the human body in realtime. 
After detecting any motion on the screen, it only makes notify if any people detected.
